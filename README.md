# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm an **AI Enthusiast** and **Data Scientist** currently making strides at **RaLytics LLC**. With a strong background in applied mathematics, I'm deeply engrossed in the intersection of data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

My interests aren't confined to just numbers and algorithms; I'm equally passionate about music and genealogy, which often lend unique perspectives to my projects. I have a habit of diving headfirst into my work, driven by what I like to call a 'painful fascination.' This relentless curiosity means I'm always fully committed to exploring and solving the complexities of a project, often finding it hard to step away until I've unraveled every layer.

## 🚀 My Work

This space is a canvas for my explorations and projects in **AI/ML**. Here, you'll find a range of projects from foundational AI models to innovative applications of machine learning in various domains. I'm particularly excited about the potential of integrating **video game mechanics** and AI to create engaging and educational experiences.

## 🎮 Interests

- **Video Games**: I am a huge retro gaming enthusiast. Future plans include expanding classic games in ROM Hacks to have larger worlds and continued storylines.
- **Music**: Whether composing, performing, or analyzing, music is a constant source of inspiration and creativity in my work.
- **Genealogy**: Unraveling the threads of history through data, I apply analytical skills to genealogical research, uncovering stories and patterns from the past. Check out my genealogy insights and projects at [Babcanec Genealogy](https://jbbabgen.wixsite.com/babgenconsultants).

## 📚 Education

- **MA in Mathematics**
- **BA in Applied Mathematics**
- **BS in Mechanical Engineering**

## 💡 Goals

My mission here is to merge my diverse interests and expertise to push the boundaries of what's possible in AI and ML, particularly in how they can enhance our understanding and enjoyment of video games, music, and history.

## 🤝 Connect

I'm always open to collaborating and discussing ideas that challenge the status quo and advance our understanding of AI and its applications. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaboration, sharing ideas, or just want to chat about the latest in AI and gaming!
